        <h4>Hi, I'm <span class="rotate">Claudia.</span></h4>
          <p>Among many other things, I'm a software developer and graphic designer located in Columbus, OH.
           I go to a little school called the Ohio State University, where I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in visual communication design.
           I love front-end development because it allows me to combine both those interests to create something beautiful and functional(hence this elaborate javascript-based portfolio site).
           The most fun part of programming for me is being creative, whether that's in the user-interactions I create or an AI algorithm behind the scenes &mdash; if I'm solving a puzzle I'm happy.</p>
            <p>Tldr; I like making cool stuff with cool people, so if you'd like to get in touch I'd love to hear from you!</p>

      <h4>ACM-W Club Cards</h4>

      <p>
        As the Media Chair for the Ohio State chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery Women's Chapter,
        I was tasked with creating a postcard to hand out to promote the club, particularly with freshman students.
        The organization supports women in technology through academic, professional, and social events, but most of our
        gatherings are open to all genders so it was important to find a balance between feminity and typical representations
        of tech. I settled on a confetti look, but created with simple geometric triangles to tie back to our technology ties,
        all in our signature purples and grays.

      <h4>Live Tour Poster</h4>

      <p>
      For my Typography class, we were given a document of text to include in a poster for  a fictional
      band tour that was intentionally created to be difficult to place on a poster. However, we were able
      to choose which musician we would like to be the headliner and design the poster to reflect that artist's style.
      I chose a quirky Canadian indie rock band. I wanted to capture the intimacy of their music, since they mostly play
      shows at small venues and interact closely with the audience. Also, most of their music explores the nature of
      growing up and being in that uncertain transitional stage between childhood and adulthood. To capture both these aspects
      I chose a design that looked like a sparsely decorated living room, with an old TV placed on the floor
      and the informational text of the poster appearing to be DIY art written directly on the wall.
      </p>

    <div class="carousel section-body">
      <img src="images/logo.png" class="section-body small" />
      <h4>Personal Logo</h4>
      <p> I originally created this logo with the intention of featuring it on this website, but I only
        ended up using it for the favicon. Still, I feel like it accurately depicts my personal brand.
        I chose a simple geometric shape for the main body of the logo because of its structure and connection to
        mathematics. I made the decision to use a septagon because I feel like it seems a little quirky, since
        it doesn't tessellate, which I felt reflected my personality a bit(also 7 is my favorite number). For
        my initials, though, I chose a cursive font since I felt like it showed my more creative side to tie in
        my interest for visual design.

      <h4>Rails Web App for Evaluating Group Members</h4>
      <p> For my Web Applications course final, the assignment was simply to build a web app using
        Rails. For each project in the course, we were able to email the professor and TAs an evaluation of
        our teammates, so my team chose to create an application to streamline this process. I took the lead on
        the design of the UI and the database, though now that I know more about relational databases I'd like to
        improve the design. We created a dashboard view, which allows students to enroll in classes and write
        evaluations of their group members, while teachers could create classes and groups and view the evaluations.
        We also created a profile for students showing their average scores, so that teachers and students could judge
        which students typically contribute the same amount to group projects. We also filtered the evaluations to pull
        ones with particularly low scores into a separate list to draw professors' attention to.

      <h4>Translational Data Analytics Challenge at OHI/O Hackathon 2015</h4>
      <p> My team created the winning project for a challenge presented by the TDA department at
Ohio State. Given a sample of real resumes and job descriptions, we developed algorithms to
compare the data sets to identify similarities and differences in what employers were looking
for and what students put on their resumes. We then represented our findings visually using a
Javascript based UI.

      <h4>Professor Site Redesign Using Middleman</h4>
      <p> For a class project we were tasked with redesigning a professor's personal site using the
        static site generator Middleman, which allows you to write a website using embedded ruby and
        Sass, but then process it into ordinary HTML and CSS. This professor had long lists of publications
        he'd written and media pieces he'd been cited in, so I chose to take advantage of the embedded ruby
        capabilities of Middleman by storing these lists in YAML files and generating tables from that data using
        Ruby. This improved readability and maintainability, as well as being great practice for developing a Rails app.

      <h4>This Site</h4>
      <p> I know it sounds really meta, but I put a lot of work into developing this site. I wanted
        to create a portfolio that was fun and interesting not only to look at, but also to navigate.
        After using Javascript at work all summer, I wanted to create something in the language that was
        truly my own. I coudln't find any examples of a lightweight sliding gallery like I wanted for my
        portfolio pages, so I built my own with JQuery. As fun as the Javascript is, though, I think my next
        step will be to create fallback links that work with Javascript disabled.
